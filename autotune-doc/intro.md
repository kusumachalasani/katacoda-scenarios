# Kruize Autotune Demo

Demo of how to use kruize Autotune.

## Description

Autotune is an Autonomous Performance Tuning Tool for Kubernetes. Autotune accepts a user provided "slo" goal to optimize application performance. It uses Prometheus to identify "layers" of an application that it is monitoring and matches tunables from those layers to the user provided slo. It then runs experiments with the help of a hyperparameter optimization framework to arrive at the most optimal values for the identified set of tunables to get a better result for the user provided slo.

## Learning Objective

- Install Kruize Autotune
- Deploy a benchmark
